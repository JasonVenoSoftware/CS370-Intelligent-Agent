# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The gameboard and goal were given to me, but my task was to implement the Q-Learning algorithm, which would find the most efficient possible route from the start point to the end point.  This involved determining the optimal number of epochs to obtain a 100% win rate.  

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science.
As a Computer Scientist, the most important skill to learn is how to approach a problem analytically.  Breaking down a problem into three basic steps (input, process, output), is what makes the mind of a Computer Scientist so unique and valuable.  This pathfinding algorithm was complex and difficult, but once I broke it down into input (the board's layout), process (analyzing the shortest path) and output (choosing said shortest path), it became much more trivial.
